    <h1>Hello! Welcome to Quantum Computers in a nutshell.</h1>
    <h2>today, we will learn about quantum computers and their aplications explained simply, without the complicated math.</h2>
    <p>Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that studies the very tiny particles that make up everything in the universe, like atoms and subatomic particles. Unlike the everyday world we see, these tiny particles behave in strange and unpredictable ways. For example, they can exist in multiple places at once, and their exact position and speed can't both be known at the same time. Quantum mechanics helps scientists understand and predict these weird behaviors, and it's used in many modern technologies like computers, lasers, and even medical imaging devices.</p>
