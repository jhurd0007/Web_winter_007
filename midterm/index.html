    <h1>this website expains how quantum computers work, and some potential uses for them.</h1>
    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>normal computers compute on bits, which are in 1 or 0. (see figure 1) This makes for how we use computers today; a long string of 1s and 0s that tell the computer what to do and say. quantum computers can be 0, 1 or any combination of probabilities of the two. they can even be in some other states beyond combinations of 0 and 1! (see figure 2)</p>

    <p>this is an example of how normal bits work; they can be in 0 or 1, but not both, and they can only be 0 or 1.<span class="span2">(figure 1^)</span></p>
    <img src="images/Bloch sphere.png" alt="A sphere with a 0 on the top and a 1 on the bottom, a negative and positive i on the left and right, and a plus and minus on the front and back">
    <p>this shows how quantum computers work; the state of the quibit can be <span class="span1">ANYWHERE</span> on the surface of the sphere, with each state having its own properties.</p>
    <p>this will be expained further on the about page.<span class="span2">(figure 2^)</span></p>
