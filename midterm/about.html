        <h2>How do Quantum Computers Work?</h2>
    </ul>
        <p>quantum computers compute on subatomic particles, which can be in between 1 and 0, and even some other states, as shown on the home page. This means they can do much more complex calculations, and as they can be a combination of probabilities of these states, they can compute on not just many, but <span class="span1">EVERY</span> path at once. this has huge implications for sorting through lots complicated information, as computing on every path would allow computers to sort lots of information much faster, or as shown with the Willow chip (see figure 4), solve complicated equations much faster.</p>
        <img src="images/quantum chip willow.png" alt="a white gloved hand holding a square silver chip with another black square in the middle">
    <p>this is also a quantum computer, made by Google, and is called Willow. it has solved an equation in under 5 minutes that would take the world's fastest normal computer 10 septilion (10^25) years! <span class="span2">(figure 4^)</span></p>
        <h2>Some Potential Uses of Quantum Computers:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li style="color:blue">Quantum Cryptology: quantum computers can be used to generate truly random numbers, which will allow for security systems that don't just rely on them being very hard to crack, as a quantum computer would crack them very fast, but quantum crytology is <span class="span1">IMPOSSIBLE</span> to crack, uping security a lot.</li>
        <li style="color:green">Simulating Large Molecules: For normal computers, simulating large molecules takes too much information and computing power, making it practically imposible. For a quantum computer, it is much easier. This has huge implications for medicinal purposes, as this could simulate viruses, which would make the process of making cures much more efficient. it could even cure cancer!</li>
        <li style="color:purple">Information Processing: Quantum computers can compute on every path at once, making processing large amounts of information easy. This can apple to many fields, especially in science, as it would allow a computer, paired with an advanced AI, to sort through lots of informations, ranging from images taken by telescopes, to results of lab experiments, and many others.</li>
