    <h1>this page shows some images on the topic of quantum mechanics, giving a deeper explanation through images.</h1>
    <img src="images/bit flip switch.png" alt="a red light switch with a 0 and a 1 on it" style="width:15%;">
    <p class="text">this is a simple explanation of how a normal computer bit works; using two states it can be in, 1 and 0, and a string of them telling the computer what to do. <span class="span2">(figure 1^)</span></p>
    <img src="images/Bloch sphere.png" alt="A sphere with a 0 on the top and a 1 on the bottom, a negative and positive i on the left and right, and a plus and minus on the front and back">
    <p class="text">this shows how quantum computers work; the state of the quibit can be anywhere on the surface of the sphere, with each state having its own properties.<span class="span2">(figure 2^)</span></p>
    <img src="images/Quantum computer.png" alt="a cilinder with three gold discs with lots of wires and tubes.">
    <p class="text">this may look out of a science fiction book, but is actually a quantum computer in use today!<span class="span2">(figure 3^)</span></p>
    <img src="images/quantum chip willow.png" alt="a white gloved hand holding a square silver chip with another black square in the middle">
    <p class="text">this is also a quantum computer, made by Google, and is called Willow. it has solved an equation in under 5 minutes that would take the world's fastest normal computer 10 septilion (10^25) years! <span class="span2">(figure 4^)</span></p>
    <img src="images/Japanese photon computer.png" alt="a complicated array of mirrors with a few computer over it.">
    <p class="text">this is yet another type of quantum computer, made by the Japanese, that uses photons, or light, to compute.<span class="span2">(figure 5^)</span></p>
    <img src="images/Ion trap quantum computer.png" alt="A box with no sides filled with a mess of wires and electronics">
    <p class="text">this is one more kind of quantum computer, that uses the charged bonds between atoms, called ions, to compute.<span class="span2">(figure 6^)</span></p>
